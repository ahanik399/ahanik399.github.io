    <!-- Analysis narrative -->
    <div class="longform-article">

      <div class="forensic-intro">
        <p>In property preservation, businesses rarely struggle because work stops coming in.</p>
        <p><strong>They struggle because value quietly fails to complete its journey.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Invoices are generated. Vendors are paid. Activity looks healthy on the surface. Yet somewhere
          between work completed and cash collected, friction appears.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
          This dashboard follows money through its full operational lifecycle — focusing not on how much
          work is done, but on how much value is actually retained.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="instruction-box">
        <h3>How to Read This Report</h3>
        <p>
          This view is designed to support clarity, not judgment. Rather than presenting isolated
          financial totals, the dashboard highlights patterns that emerge when operational effort,
          vendor execution, and client processes interact over time.
          <strong>The goal is visibility — making quiet inefficiencies observable before they become structural.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <section class="analysis-section">

        <div class="analysis-block">
          <h2>The Retention Gap</h2>
          <p>High revenue often creates a sense of security.</p>
          <p>
            But revenue alone does not reveal how much value survives the operational process. By examining
            how funds move from invoicing to collection, this analysis exposes the <strong>retention gap</strong> —
            the difference between reported performance and financial reality. When that gap widens, the
            business may remain busy while its financial footing quietly weakens.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis-block">
          <h2>Receivables as Risk</h2>
          <p>Delayed payments are often treated as temporary timing issues.</p>
          <p>
            In practice, prolonged receivables frequently signal deeper operational friction. Documentation
            quality, approval cycles, and submission accuracy all influence whether value is eventually
            recovered. As delays stretch across billing cycles, the likelihood of full recovery declines —
            turning delay into exposure.
          </p>
          <p>
            This perspective reframes receivables as <strong>operational risk</strong>, not just accounting backlog.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis-block">
          <h2>Income Efficiency Signal</h2>
          <p>Operational efficiency is not only about cost control — it is about value retention.</p>
          <p>
            When increasing effort produces diminishing retained value, the issue is rarely workload.
            It is misalignment between execution, pricing, and process design. Income efficiency serves as
            an early warning signal, highlighting when operations consume more energy than they preserve.
          </p>
          <p>This dashboard helps make that imbalance visible while corrective action is still possible.</p>

          <strong>Note:</strong> This report is not intended to replace accounting systems, forecasting tools,
          or financial advisory services. It is an operational analysis designed to help owners, managers, and
          distributed teams identify where friction emerges across real workflows — before margin erosion
          becomes normalized.

      <div class="data-disclaimer">
        <p>
          All data presented in this dashboard is anonymized or simulated and used strictly for analytical
          demonstration and testing purposes. No real clients, vendors, properties, or organizations are
          represented. The focus is on illustrating operational patterns, not reporting live financial activity.
