        <p style="margin-top:0;">In property preservation, businesses rarely struggle because work stops coming in.</p>
        <p><strong>They struggle because value quietly fails to complete its journey.</strong></p>
        <p>Invoices are generated. Vendors are paid. Activity looks healthy on the surface. Yet somewhere between work completed and cash collected, friction appears.</p>

        <h3>How to Read This Data</h3>
        <p>
          This view highlights patterns that emerge when operational effort interacts with client payment cycles. <strong>The goal is visibility—making quiet inefficiencies observable before they become structural.</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="analysis-block">
          <h2>The Retention Gap</h2>
          <p>High revenue often creates a sense of security. But revenue alone does not reveal how much value survives the operational process.</p> 
          <p>By examining how funds move from invoicing to collection, this analysis exposes the <strong>retention gap</strong>—the difference between reported performance and financial reality. When that gap widens, the business may remain busy while its financial footing quietly weakens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis-block">
          <h2>Receivables as Risk</h2>
          <p>Delayed payments are often treated as temporary timing issues. In practice, prolonged receivables frequently signal deeper operational friction.</p>
          <p>Documentation quality, approval cycles, and submission accuracy all influence whether value is eventually recovered. This perspective reframes receivables as <strong>operational risk</strong>, not just accounting backlog.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis-block">
          <h2>Income Efficiency Signal</h2>
          <p>When increasing effort produces diminishing retained value, the issue is rarely workload. It is misalignment between execution, pricing, and process design.</p>
          <p>Income efficiency serves as an early warning signal, highlighting when operations consume more energy than they preserve.</p>
