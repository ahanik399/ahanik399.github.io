          <p style="margin-top:0;">In property preservation, businesses rarely struggle because work stops coming in.
          </p>
          <p><strong>They struggle because value quietly fails to complete its journey.</strong></p>
          <p>Invoices are generated. Vendors are paid. Activity looks healthy on the surface. Yet somewhere between work
            completed and cash collected, friction appears.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom:0;">This dashboard exists to follow money through its full operational lifecycle,
            focusing not on how much work is done, but on how much value is actually retained.</p>

      <h3>How to Read This Page</h3>
      <p>
        This view is designed to support clarity, not judgment. Rather than presenting isolated financial totals, the
        dashboard highlights patterns that emerge when operational effort, vendor execution, and client processes
        interact over time. <strong>The goal is visibility—making quiet inefficiencies observable before they become
          structural.</strong>

        <h2>The Retention Gap</h2>
        <p>High revenue often creates a sense of security.</p>
        <p>But revenue alone does not reveal how much value survives the operational process. By examining how funds
          move from invoicing to collection, this analysis exposes the <strong>retention gap</strong>—the difference
          between reported performance and financial reality. When that gap widens, the business may remain busy while
          its financial footing quietly weakens.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="analysis-block">
        <h2>Receivables as Risk</h2>
        <p>Delayed payments are often treated as temporary timing issues.</p>
        <p>In practice, prolonged receivables frequently signal deeper operational friction. Documentation quality,
          approval cycles, and submission accuracy all influence whether value is eventually recovered. As delays
          stretch across billing cycles, the likelihood of full recovery declines—turning delay into exposure.</p>
        <p>This perspective reframes receivables as <strong>operational risk</strong>, not just accounting backlog.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="analysis-block">
        <h2>Income Efficiency Signal</h2>
        <p>Operational efficiency is not only about cost control—it is about value retention.</p>
        <p>When increasing effort produces diminishing retained value, the issue is rarely workload. It is misalignment
          between execution, pricing, and process design. Income efficiency serves as an early warning signal,
          highlighting when operations consume more energy than they preserve.</p>
        <p>This dashboard helps make that imbalance visible while corrective action is still possible.</p>

        <strong>Note:</strong> This report is not intended to replace accounting systems, forecasting tools, or
        financial advisory services. It is an operational analysis designed to help owners, managers, and distributed
        teams identify where friction emerges across real workflows—before margin erosion becomes normalized.
