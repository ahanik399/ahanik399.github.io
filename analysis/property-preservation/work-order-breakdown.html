    <!-- Analysis narrative -->
    <div class="longform-article">

      <div class="forensic-intro">
        <p>In property preservation, volume is often treated as success.</p>
        <p><strong>More orders. More activity. More movement. But volume alone does not indicate health.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Some work types strengthen an operation as they scale. Others quietly weaken it —
          introducing friction, rework, and margin erosion that only becomes visible after damage is done.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
          This analysis exists to separate productive volume from destructive volume.

        <h3>How to Read This Report</h3>
        <p>
          This report does not evaluate individual work orders.
          <strong>It evaluates patterns of behavior.</strong> Each work type is examined as a recurring
          operational process — how often it occurs, how efficiently it moves through approvals, and how
          consistently it retains value. When those signals are combined, they reveal whether a service
          is contributing to stability or quietly increasing risk.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section class="analysis-section">

        <div class="analysis-block">
          <h2>Work Types as Risk Profiles</h2>
          <p>Individual jobs rarely tell the full story.</p>
          <p>
            Risk emerges only when similar work types repeat under the same conditions. When a service consistently
            generates rework, deductions, or pricing pressure, it becomes a predictable source of friction —
            regardless of how well any single order is executed.
          </p>
          <p>This matrix treats each work type as a system, not an exception.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis-block">
          <h2>High Volume Can Hide Structural Issues</h2>
          <p>Some services appear successful because they happen frequently.</p>
          <p>
            High activity can mask inefficiencies that would be obvious at lower volume. As order counts increase,
            even small execution gaps multiply — turning manageable issues into persistent drains on time, cash
            flow, and operational focus.
          </p>
          <p>Volume without efficiency does not scale profit. It scales exposure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis-block">
          <h2>Classification Is About Alignment</h2>
          <p>When certain services are flagged as high-risk, the issue is rarely lack of effort.</p>
          <p>
            More often, the problem lies in misalignment — between pricing, scope, documentation requirements,
            and execution reality. When those elements are out of sync, rework becomes unavoidable regardless
            of team performance.
          </p>
          <p>This analysis helps identify where adjustment is required before scale amplifies loss.</p>

            The most important outcome of this report is visibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once work types are clearly classified by how they behave at scale, operators can make informed
            decisions — whether that means adjusting pricing, refining scope, changing vendors, or redesigning
            documentation flow.

          <strong>Note:</strong> This report is not a recommendation engine and does not prescribe operational
          action. It provides a structured lens for understanding how different services behave under real
          operating conditions — especially in high-volume, distributed property preservation environments.
          The goal is informed decision-making, not automated conclusions.
