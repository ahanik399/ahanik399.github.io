      <p style="margin-top:0;">In property preservation, volume is often treated as success.</p>
      <p><strong>More orders. More activity. More movement. But volume alone does not indicate health.</strong></p>
      <p>Some work types strengthen an operation as they scale. Others quietly weaken it—introducing friction, rework, and margin erosion that only becomes visible after damage is done.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">This analysis exists to separate productive volume from destructive volume.</p>

      <h3>How to Read This Page</h3>
      <p>
        This report does not evaluate individual work orders. <strong>It evaluates patterns of behavior.</strong> Each work type is examined as a recurring operational process—how often it occurs, how efficiently it moves through approvals, and how consistently it retains value. When those signals are combined, they reveal whether a service is contributing to stability or quietly increasing risk.
      </p>
    </div>

    <section class="analysis-section">
      <div class="analysis-block">
        <h2>Work Types as Risk Profiles</h2>
        <p>Individual jobs rarely tell the full story.</p>
        <p>Risk emerges only when similar work types repeat under the same conditions. When a service consistently generates rework, deductions, or pricing pressure, it becomes a predictable source of friction—regardless of how well any single order is executed.</p>
        <p>This matrix treats each work type as a system, not an exception.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="analysis-block">
        <h2>High Volume Can Hide Structural Issues</h2>
        <p>Some services appear successful because they happen frequently.</p>
        <p>High activity can mask inefficiencies that would be obvious at lower volume. As order counts increase, even small execution gaps multiply—turning manageable issues into persistent drains on time, cash flow, and operational focus.</p>
        <p>Volume without efficiency does not scale profit. It scales exposure.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="analysis-block">
        <h2>Classification Is About Alignment</h2>
        <p>When certain services are flagged as high-risk, the issue is rarely lack of effort.</p>
        <p>More often, the problem lies in misalignment—between pricing, scope, documentation requirements, and execution reality. When those elements are out of sync, rework becomes unavoidable regardless of team performance.</p>
        <p>This analysis helps identify where adjustment is required before scale amplifies loss.</p>
      </div>

        <p style="font-weight: 700; color: var(--accent);">The most important outcome of this report is visibility.</p>
        <p>Once work types are clearly classified by how they behave at scale, operators can make informed decisions—whether that means adjusting pricing, refining scope, changing vendors, or redesigning documentation flow.</p>
        <p><em>Insight precedes correction.</em></p>

        <strong>Note:</strong> This report is not a recommendation engine and does not prescribe operational action. It provides a structured lens for understanding how different services behave under real operating conditions—especially in high-volume, distributed property preservation environments. The goal is informed decision-making, not automated conclusions.
