    The Maintenance Deficit
  </h1>

  <p class="article-dek">
    How documentation failures quietly compound operational losses
    across property preservation workflows.
  </p>

  <!-- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -->
  <section class="article-section">
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This investigation examines how incomplete, mis-sequenced,
      and low-quality documentation creates systemic failure points
      in property preservation operations—long before quality control
      review or invoicing occurs.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FINDINGS -->
  <section class="article-section">
    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Most documentation failures occur before QC review.</li>
      <li>Rework cycles are driven by structural incentives, not vendor negligence.</li>
      <li>Loss accumulates silently through delays, resubmissions, and deductions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ANALYSIS -->
  <section class="article-section">
    <h2>How the Deficit Forms</h2>
    <p>
      Field documentation requirements emphasize completeness at submission,
      but vendors often lack real-time feedback on photo sufficiency,
      sequencing, and clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, failures propagate downstream—triggering rework,
      delayed approvals, and reduced margins.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- EVIDENCE -->
  <section class="article-section">
    <h2>Evidence & Data Notes</h2>
    <p>
      This investigation draws on aggregated work order patterns,
      documentation standards, and rejection trends observed
      across preservation workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      No proprietary client data is disclosed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
  <section class="article-section">
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Documentation failure is often treated as an isolated quality issue.
      In reality, it represents a systemic operational risk that compounds
      across portfolios.
