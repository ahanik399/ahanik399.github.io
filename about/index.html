        <h1>Insight Gaps</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          An independent public-interest research bureau focused on surfacing hidden operational
          patterns through forensic data analysis.
        </p>
      </header>

      <div class="forensic-intro">
        <p>
          Most operational failure is not dramatic. It is quiet, structural, and accumulative —
          invisible to standard reporting until it has already compounded.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
          Insight Gaps exists to make those patterns visible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
      <p>
        No corporate funding. No advertising. No paywalls on core investigations.
        The Bureau's analytical conclusions are not for sale — they are derived from data,
        following the evidence wherever it leads.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not accept funding from organizations we investigate or analyze.
        We do not take positions on behalf of clients in public reporting.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Publish</h2>
      <p>
        Insight Gaps publishes two categories of work:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Public investigations</strong> are fully open-access forensic reports examining
        systemic operational issues — available to any reader, journalist, or researcher.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Applied analysis</strong> translates investigative findings into operational
        intelligence — structured forensic reports on specific domains, available publicly
        and as the basis for commissioned private engagements.
      </p>

      <h2>Commissioned Work</h2>
      <p>
        The Bureau accepts a limited number of private operational diagnostics for organizations
        facing complex documentation or workflow failures. These private engagements follow the
        exact same methodology and independence standards as our public investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commissioned work is delivered under strict confidentiality. No client names, data,
        or findings from private engagements are disclosed publicly.
      </p>

      <h2>Methods &amp; Standards</h2>
      <p>
        All Bureau work follows documented analytical standards. Our methodology — including
        data sourcing, anonymization practices, and analytical frameworks — is published openly.
